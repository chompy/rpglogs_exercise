# Nathan RPGLogs Exercise

This is the take-home coding exercise for the RPGLogs Full Stack Developer interview as completed by me, Nathan Ogden.
For this exercise I choose to source my data from FFLogs as opposed to WarcraftLogs as I'm intimately familar with FFLogs.


## Extra Features Of Note

- Display character avatar via fetch from FFXIV Lodestone site.

## Missing Features

Features I would have added if I had more time...

- Ability to use the browser's back/foward buttons to load previous queries.
- Ability to access character parses via sharable URL.
- Display more character data.
- Limit previous queries to one entry per character+server combination.
